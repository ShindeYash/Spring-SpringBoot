Here We have learned to use the DependencyInjection.

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern where an object (or dependency) is provided to a class from the outside rather than the class creating it itself.

This approach ensures loose coupling, making the code more flexible, testable, and easier to maintain. The dependency is usually injected by a framework like Spring, which manages the creation and lifecycle of the dependencies.
